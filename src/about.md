title: About
lead: The PIT clinic focuses on serving public interests through applied research, experiential learning, and community based organizing. We achieve this by partnering with advocates, mutual aid organizations, and special-interest groups, as well as local governments throughout the Puget Sound region. Our current work is focused on digital civic infrastructure, digital privacy, and labor policy.

## Vision

A growing coalition of technologists, educators, researchers, and community organizations cooperatively advancing the public interest to face the escalating crises of postmodernity.
